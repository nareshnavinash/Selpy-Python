amazon_product_description: "Product description\nReview\n\"[Hosanagar's] 'predictability-resilience\
  \ paradox' is conveyed convincingly. He excels in arguing for an algorithmic bill\
  \ of rights, one based on the original ideal of self-regulation by government and\
  \ by individuals . . . Algorthimic decision making and its influence in our lives\
  \ requires our attention and study.\"\n\u2014Library Journal \n\n\"Especially relevant\
  \ to current political hot topics, Hosanagar's outstanding introduction to algorithms\
  \ will appeal to and inform readers interested in learning more about the systems\
  \ that determine what they're exposed to online.\"\n\u2014Booklist.com\n\n\"Hosanagar\
  \ deserves credit for valiantly attempting, throughout this thoughtful treatise,\
  \ to widen understanding of a technology central to modern society.\"\n\u2014Publishers\
  \ Weekly\n\n\"The most useful part of the book is Hosanagar's 'algorithmic bill\
  \ of rights,' which would give consumers insight into the AI that surrounds them,\
  \ if not some measure of control.\"\n\u2014Kirkus Reviews\n\n\u201CAs we negotiate\
  \ the uneasy interactions between man and the intelligent machine, Kartik Hosanagar\u2019\
  s important and very timely book, helps us to understand a world increasingly dominated\
  \ by often opaque algorithms that take more and more decisions in our lives. His\
  \ proposal for an Algorithmic Bill of Rights needs to be acted on at the earliest!\u201D\
  \n\u2014Nandan Nilekani, Co-founder and Chairman of Infosys\n \n\u201CAI is finally\
  \ here, from guiding us home on Waze, to helping us choose a restaurant, a book\
  \ or a job. I believe this will launch a Renaissance of human creativity as mundane\
  \ tasks become handled by AI. Kartik Hosanagar\u2019s excellent book identifies\
  \ the growing pains we may experience along the way to this new human advancement.\u201D\
  \n\u2014Tim Draper, founding partner of venture capital firm DFJ\n\n\"Algorithms\
  \ and artificial intelligence are overturning the rules of society, but their true\
  \ impact is still in its infancy. Hosanagar's book is the best guide yet to understanding\
  \ these digital forces reshaping our lives. Rigorous yet readable, filled with insight\
  \ and perspective from one of our smartest thinkers about technology.\"\n\u2014\
